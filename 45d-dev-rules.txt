Ceph Ansible Playbooks Development Rules
- ceph-ansible-45d is being archived, we are now working from a fork of ceph-ansible.
    Allows for easier merging of code fomr the ceph-ansible source

- Versioning is being changed to match ceph-ansible's versioning. Meaning we will be jumping right to 5.0
    5.0 -> Octopus
    6.0 -> Pacific
    ....

- No main ceph roles are to be edited unless neccesary. If neccesary to edit a ceph role always add to to dont remove or change.
    no one is to add/edit/or rremove from main ceph oles without permission
    An example: if needing to run a play to create custom crush rules that runs right after ceph-osd creation
    Do not add to existing ceph-osd role, create new playbook (or role is function is big enough to warrent role) and have this playbook be run after ceph-osd role in core.yml playbook.

- Work from 45drives labeled branchs at all times, do not work from any of source branches.

	branches will take the form "stable-$MAJORVERSION.$MINORVERSION-45d"
    
- to build RPM use "make rpm" from the root of git repo
